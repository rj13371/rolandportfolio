<VisibilityComponent children={<Text text={`I am a self taught Fullstack Web Developer since April 2021 currently learning the MERN tech stack. In January of 2021 I graduated with a Bachelors in Political Science but decided to learn Software development after wanting to pursue a career as a software engineer. 
Since then I have focused mainly on Web development but my love of blockchain pushed me to enter several Ethereum hackathons, eventually becoming a finalist with team FIN. Currently I am participating in several hackathons and learning Solidity.
While im not programming I enjoy travelling, playing card games and listening to 80's Japanese pop hits.
